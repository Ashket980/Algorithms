Backtracking algorithm used in the program:-

>>Fix a character in the first position and swap the rest of the character with the first character.
  Like in ABC, in the first iteration three strings are formed: ABC, BAC, and CBA by swapping A with
  A, B and C respectively.
>>Repeat step 1 for the rest of the characters like fixing second character B and so on.
>>Now swap again to go back to the previous position. E.g., from ABC, we formed ABC by fixing B again,
  and we backtrack to the previous position and swap B with C. So, now we got ABC and ACB.
>>Repeat these steps for BAC and CBA, to get all the permutations.
