*A matrix is sparse if many of its coefficients are zero (In general if 2/3rd of matrix elements are 0, it is considered as sparse). 
*The interest in sparsity arises because its exploitation can lead to enormous computational savings and because many large matrix problems that occur in practice are sparse.
