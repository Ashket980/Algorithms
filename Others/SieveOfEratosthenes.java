/**
 * Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers
 * up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e.,
 * not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number,
 * 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers
 * starting from that prime, with constant difference between them that is equal
 * to that prime. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division
 * to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.
 * Once all the multiples of each discovered prime have been marked as
 * composites, the remaining unmarked numbers are primes.
 * <p>
 * Poetry about Sieve of Eratosthenes:
 * <p>
 * <i>Sift the Two's and Sift the Three's:</i></p>
 * <p>
 * <i>The Sieve of Eratosthenes.</i></p>
 * <p>
 * <i>When the multiples sublime,</i></p>
 * <p>
 * <i>The numbers that remain are Prime.</i></p>
